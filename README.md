# CAD-Fixture-Design
Computer-Aided Design and 3D Printing of a Fixture for Cylinder Processing
Project Overview
This project involves designing and fabricating a fixture to securely hold a cylinder for robotic processing. Using SOLIDWORKS, a 3D model was developed and 3D printed using PLA material.

Features
Secure locking mechanism to prevent rotation
Easy insertion and removal of the cylinder
Fabricated using FDM 3D printing
Optimized design through prototyping and testing
Technologies Used
SOLIDWORKS (CAD Design)
FDM 3D Printing (PLA Material)
Prototyping & Fabrication
Quality Control & Testing
Future Improvements
Using stronger materials like ABS or Carbon Fiber PLA
Enhancing the locking mechanism for greater stability
Reducing manufacturing time with optimized 3D printing settings
